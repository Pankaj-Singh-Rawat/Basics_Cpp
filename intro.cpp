#include <iostream> // header file library , let's us work with I/O Objects like cout
using namespace std; // we can use names for variables and objects\

int main(){ // main is the function , code inside this will be executed
    cout << "Hello World."; // cout is an object and << ( is output ) , it will output "whatever is inside here".
    return 0 ; // return is ending the main function here and, ; -> this is used to terminate a line
